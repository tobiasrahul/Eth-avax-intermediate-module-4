# Degen Token (ERC-20): Unlocking the Future of Gaming
Degen Gaming ðŸŽ®, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention ðŸ§ 

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store, but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growthðŸ“ˆ

# Introduction
In this project of module 4 of [ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/content/solidity-avax-intermediate) by Metacrafters our  task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:
* Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
* Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
* Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
* Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
* Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
